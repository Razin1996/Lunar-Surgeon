# Lunar-Surgeon
We are using advanced autonomous algorithm to help the rover to navigate through the lunar surface.During the navigation process the lunar rover will find the proper place for conducting the soil sample collection process using the lunar surface images from NASAâ€™s open data portal.Considering different parameters it will choose a particular place for further analysis of the surrounding soil and rocks. Our system will automatically connect with the NASA lunar database to find the similarities and dissimilarities.Finally it will decide the places it needs to analyze with the help of on-board science experiment unit.
