# Lunar-Surgeon
We are providing a complete solution to enrich the existing lunar data in NASA’s open data portal.Around 3-4 billion years ago huge explosions by the asteroids helped to exchange a lot of materials of outer surface between our home planet and the moon.As the atmosphere of the moon is a vacuum and there is no active biology the rocks of the early stage of the earth which were bought by the explosion are almost unchanged.So if we are able to collect those rocks we can know what was earth like in 3-4 billion years ago.But even after countless lunar missions we are unable to find enough of these rocks.So after conducting a research on past lunar missions we came up with a unique solution.Our proposed solution have both software and hardware prototypes.For autonomous traversal in the lunar soil we are using customized machine learning and computer vision algorithms to analyze the lunar environment and find the proper place to conduct further experiments.We are using thousands of lunar landscape images of NASA’s lunar data repository from NASA open data portal.After reaching the designated place it will scan the surrounding rocks and soils.The rock and geological archive will help to determine whether these soils are present in the latest data repository and if it further analysis needed with the help of custom AI algorithms.It the match each and every rock with the existing database in real time.If it can find what it is looking for the lunar rover will go to the next step in the analysis process the “Science experiment”.For this we are building the second version of our science unit prototype .The first version is already tested in the MDRS(Mars Desert Research Station) successfully.This unit is consist of almost seven differnt soil experiment units : Nitrogen ,Phosphorus ,Potassium ,Amino acid, Biomass ,Water capillary .We have also have separate unit consist of all kinds of gas sensor to detect air samples.If the result is positive the onboard system will automatically collect necessary amount of needed samples and store it in a vacuum chamber to bring it back to the earth.This will solve the drawbacks of existing sample collection process and will save time and cost.We need to understand our neighbour first to reveal many mysteries not just outside our home planet but also of our planet earth.

# 5 Benefits of our project
  a.Maximum amount of unknown samples in a single mission.
  b.Reducing the time and cost.
  c.Enriching lunar data repository in real time.
  d.Less human monitoring .
  e.Best use of huge NASA repository.

# Our Future Plan with this Project
  Make a complete prototype 
  Test our prototype in a space simulated environment. 
  Analysing the test results from hundreds of tests and make a better algorithms and full custom hardware.
